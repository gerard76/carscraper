New version from https://github.com/gerard76/carcrawler

It fetches the car model you are interested in and plots the result in a scatterplot
so it is easier to see which cars are bargains.

The plot puts year and price on the axis and uses color to give you information about the milage (which may vary)

# Get started

Create you first model: `Model.create(make: 'Fiat', model: 'Ducato')`

Fetch matching cars: `Scrapers::Autoscout24.new(Model.first).scrape`
See the graph on http://localhost:3000/cars
